This Python tool is a fork of Saint Radon's original repository. It's designed for scraping Catbox links from 4chan threads and downloading associated images and text files.

## Features

- **Board Selection:** You can specify a list of 4chan boards to scrape from. Modify the list as needed, adding or removing boards to suit your preferences.

- **Custom Search:** This tool can search for threads with titles that match your chosen keywords. You have the flexibility to edit and manage this list of keyphrases to focus on threads of interest.

- **Link Tracking:** To avoid re-downloading the same files, the tool keeps a record of processed links. You can delete individual links or clear the entire tracking file as necessary.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the code to your local machine.
2. Customize your board list and keyphrases in the configuration.
3. Run the script and enjoy automated scraping and downloading of Catbox links.

Please note that the content available on 4chan can be unpredictable and may include explicit or controversial material. Use this tool responsibly and in accordance with 4chan's terms of service and any applicable laws.
